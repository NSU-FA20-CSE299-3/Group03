<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>

<p><em>Frontend: </em></p>
<p>Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. Android Studio offers features that enhance our productivity when building Android apps. I am going to use android studio to design my app and will use java to handle various operations. I will design buttons, images, layout, input field etc using Android Studio for this I will need XML.</p>

<p><em>Backend: </em></p>
<p>Firebase is Google’s mobile application development platform that helps us build, improve, and grow our app. Firebase lets us handle Email & password & Real-time data, Gives us Built-in security, Allows us file storage backed by Google Cloud Storage. I am going to use firebase as my database. And using firebase I’m going to handle backend.</p>

<p><em>Payment method: </em></p>
<p>Cash on delivery or will use API of other platforms to confirm payment like bkash, Paytm. Coupon system will also be available there.</p>

<p><em>User Profile: </em></p>
<p>Every user have will have their own profile. Where they will be able to add there information and later on if they want to update they will also be able to update those information.  They will also be able to add image to their profile.</p>

<p><em>Search Option: </em></p>
<p>The app will have multiple search option. The user will be able to search from search bar or they will also be able to search by categories.</p>

<p><em>Review System: </em></p>
<p>The app will have review system. Every user will be able to rate product. They will also be able to edit the rating the once gave.</p>

<p><em>Reward System: </em></p>
<p>The app will have a reward system users. Users will get coupon based on their amount of purchase. They will be able to use these coupons later on to buy different items. There will also be a coupon checking system. This way the app will be able to filter fake coupons.</p>

<p><em>Stock update: </em></p>
<p>Stock will update regularly if someone buy any product. This will also show out of stock if there is no product available.</p>

<p><em>Dialog option: </em></p>
<p>There will be dialog system so if someone doesn’t have account he will still be able to add products in his cart. But later on the dialog box will ask him to create an account. This dialog box will also help to edit his cart/ change quantity.</p>

<p><em>Payment System: </em></p>
<p>This app will have multiple payment system. Cash on delivery and online payment. For cash on delivery there will be OTP confirmation system. They will receive massage on their phone about order confirmation. Will also integrate bkash api/paytm for online payment.</p>


<p><strong>Ecommerce with android</strong></p>
<p>A huge number of people uses android phone in our country and over the world. So an E-commerce android application will be able to target a large group of people. And a lot of people will be able to get service from this app.</p>

<p><strong>Monetization </strong></p>
<p>The user will not pay any subscription fee to use this that means they will be able to use it for free but I will integrate google AdMob in this app. AdMob helps translate one’s hard work into earnings, Google AdMob makes it easy for developers to earn money from their app. That’s how the cost for developing this application will reimburse.</p>

<p><strong>Social aspect</strong></p>
<p>This app will have significant economic effect like reducing the transaction cost, it will reduce transaction costs by removing many of the geographic and time barriers that buyers and sellers previously faced. It will also save time of its users as it they will not have to go outside to buy their products.</p>
